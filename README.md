# Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, containing real-world anonymized transaction data. The goal is to build a classification model that can effectively distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download).   

## 🏗️ Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling imbalanced data
   - Adding Features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding features 
   - Add features fraud vs. legitimate transactions  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Training a **Logistic Regression model**
   - - Evaluating using **accuracy 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Model Training & Evaluation)
